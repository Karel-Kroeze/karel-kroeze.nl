        <p> I'm a graduate student at the departments of <a href="https://utwente.nl/bms/ist">Instructional Technology</a> and <a href="https://utwente.nl/bms/omd">Research Methodology, Measurements and Data Analysis</a>. I graduated <i>Cum Laude</i> from <a href="https://uu.nl">Utrecht University</a>, creating an R package to simulate and administer multidimensional, polytomous computerized adaptive tests with the Shadow Testing approach to enforcing test constraints under the supervision of Prof. dr. Cees Glas and Prof. dr. ir. Bernard Veldkamp. You can find that package <a href="https://github.com/Karel-Kroeze/ShadowCAT@backup">here</a>. I've also collaborated on several <a href="publications.html">articles</a>.</p>
        <p>My PhD project is about Adaptivity in Inquiry Learning. I'm working on smart tools that can help students perform inquiry tasks at their own level, and that are easy to adapt to different content domains. By adapting to the students level, we can help <i>all</i> students learn better - no matter their current ability. My supervisors are Prof. dr. Ton de Jong, Prof. dr. ir. Bernard Veldkamp, Prof. dr. Ard Lazonder and Prof. dr. Stephanie van den Berg.
